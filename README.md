# Hearthstone Deck Compare

This is a tool that allows you to compare two Hearthstone decks. Simply paste in two Hearthstone deck strings, hit enter, and you will be shown the differences between them.

The application is built with React and JavaScript, and uses the npm package "deckstrings" to decode the deckstrings and the HearthstoneJSON API to lookup cards.

## Live Application
